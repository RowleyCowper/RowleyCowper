- 👋 Hi, I’m @RowleyCowper
- 👀 I’m interested in many things, most of them nerdy...obviously.  Why else would I be here?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to juggle kids and passion projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on geeky projects, particularly ones where "over-designed" is analogous to unbridled internal childhood joy.
- 📫 How to reach me - carefully.  I startle easy and long hugs make me nervous.
